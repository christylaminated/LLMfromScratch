# GPT Model from Scratch 🧠💬

This repository contains my journey through building a GPT-style language model from the ground up. It includes essential components such as text preprocessing, attention mechanisms, model implementation, and both pretraining and fine-tuning tasks.

## 📁 Contents

### 2. Working with Text Data  
Clean, tokenize, and prepare text data for language modeling.

### 3. Coding Attention Mechanisms  
Implement core components of the transformer architecture, including scaled dot-product attention and multi-head attention.

### 4. Implementing a GPT Model from Scratch to Generate Text  
Build a full GPT-style transformer model using PyTorch and train it to generate coherent text.

### 5. Pretraining on Unlabeled Data  
Train the model on unlabeled text using language modeling objectives to learn general-purpose language representations.

### 6. Fine-Tuning for Classification  
Adapt the pretrained model to a supervised text classification task by adding a classification head.

### 7. Fine-Tuning to Follow Instructions  
Fine-tune the model with instruction-based data to align it for more interactive and helpful outputs.
